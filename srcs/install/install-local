##
## This script installs the Startus-related Faust files into a pre-existing 
## Faust installation.
##
## Therefore you must already have installed Faust for this script to work.
##
## Use this script to install these components on your computer.
## Use the install-sdk script to install onto the Stratus itself
##
## During this installation, your Stratus will not be touched. You can
## leave it completely unconnected. If you accidentally left it at your
## last gig, or in the band rehearsal space, this script doesn't care!
